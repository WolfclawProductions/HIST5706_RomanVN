# Dev Log 3: The Final Shape	

This Dev Log comes a bit late, but for good reasons. The pre-alpha stage (prepwork) has finally hit a point that I'm happy with, along with Minor Changes in Format. 

So, here's the final devlog. 

## Essay
The Essay section of the project is now around 60% complete. The opening sections contain the theoritical approach, summary of data, and a description of the game Pathologic 2, a major inspiration to the core design and structure. 

It offers a theoretical premise that digitally-reconstructed spaces are a powerful tool for story-focused historical narratives, especially for aspects of past societies wherin records are sparce but material evidence is high, such as the lives of urban Romans of the lower classes. It hopes to break away from the "Roman Canon", by looking at the lives and perspectives of lower society, moving away from the elite writings that so often make up the body of classical studies. 

The essay also serves as a declaration of personal intent, drawing from class themes of storytelling and historical narrative, that reconstructive history is a powerful tool for creating informed, entertaining, and educational narratives. It is a rejection of the deconstructionalist trend of the modern humanities. 

## The Game
Minor structural changes to the presentation. Instead of being an adaptation of the essay into visual novel, a more "Show don't tell" approach will be adopted.  

Adopting the narrative of a long-term project of mine, *Ten Days in August '79'*, the visual novel will serve as a proof-of-concept for the dialogue and storytelling of this game project, hopefully free from the bugs and major errors that can be produced by a mainstream game engine. The Visual Novel demo will incorporate a single day of the story, mostly focused around the single finished environment, the Theatre District.

Backgrounds and character art will be rendered in Unreal engine, borrowing from the other white box demo of the exploration and environmental section of *Ten Days*.

### Environments
At time of writing, the Pompeii street model has been deployed in Unreal, as well as topography of the Vesuvius area derived from a heightmap of the area.

### Characters
I set aside the idea of making character assets and rigs by hand, and instead used the Metahumans character generator. The only thing I have to create is clothing. This way, the characters are fully rigged and ready to go, and come with their own face rigs and controls. This will make it easy to create Visual Novel expression sheets.
