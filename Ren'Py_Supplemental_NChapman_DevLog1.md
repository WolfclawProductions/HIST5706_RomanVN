# Dev Log 1: A research essay, in Visual Novel Format

## An essay on Roman Provincial Life, a model of Pompeii, and the Ren'py engine

So, here's the current plan. I've done some experimenting with converting one of my Roman essays into a textual medium, through Twine. This went well and opened up avenues to providing supplemental information through clickable boxes that took the reader to a smaller page, with information on a person or event. For example, the first mention of Julius Caesar includes a clickable link that opened up a supplemental paragraph on Caesar's life. 

I think this could be taken a step further with the inclusion of images. This has lead me to the idea of using the Ren'py engine as a medium of presenting an essay on Roman colonial life and politics. What I ultimately hope to do is to feed together work from three projects: "Roman Magistrate Simultor", for DIGH 5000, a planned 3D exploration and role-playing game set in the town of Pompeii. Yes, Pompeii, as in the model i'm making for Dr. Graham's CRANE project. Finally, this project, which will use the 3D models in rendered form as visual aids along with conventional photography. All three will share a core of assets and research, but will implement them in fundamentally different ways. This project will be the most research-oriented, involving a scholarly essay on Roman colonial life. This research will also inform other projects. 

## First Steps

The first steps is to establish a source and asset list for the visual novel, and begin collating design plans into a combination of a Game Design Docuement and Essay outline. Asset creation will also be key step. I plan on finishing my reconstruction of the Pompeiian theatre district by the end of the week, and prepare to deploy assets into a "white box " build, discussing Roman theatrical performances and entertainment as a proof of concept. Creating a character model for the "tour guide" for the essay will also be on the table soon.
