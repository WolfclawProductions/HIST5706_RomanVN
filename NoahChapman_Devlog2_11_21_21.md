# Dev Log 2: A research essay, in Visual Novel Format

## Research
It's been a while since I've written a proper essay. Almost two years, in fact. It took a while to get up and running again. The last two weeks have largely been prep work. Gathering sources and preparing imagery have been the main part of the work, as well as making plans for how to implement an essay into a visual novel format. 

I've more or less concluded that this will have to be a "White Box" version of the game, either using unfinished assets or placeholders, as creating all imagery and models for the game will not be feasible in the time I have. Luckily, the Pompeii theatre model is well on it's way to being done. 

While the game itself may lack polish, the essay itself will be a full paper. I'm aiming for around 10 pages, so about 5000 words. Research is well underway. I'm primarily utilizing two excellent sourcebooks, "Pompeii and Herculaneum-A Sourcebook" (Routledge, 2nd ed, 2014), and "The Roman Street- Urban Life and Society in Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Rome" (Cambridge, 2017). Both very modern pieces, along with supplemental papers for the core topics. I aim to have the full paper completed by the next Devlog. 

## Gameplay

Players will be provided a "Tour Guide", a 3D model turned into a 2D sprite, in the form of a Pompeiian Magistrate, a character who will also appear in my other game project this semester. This "Tour Guide" will serve as the main cypher for the player, and most of his lines will be supplemental material outside of the main essay, adding flavor and character to the piece. 

The format will supplement the essay by providing imagery as well as supplemental information through conversations and optional dialogue, allowing the player to gain additional information through side conversations. 

## Next Steps- Nov. 22 to 28

I've made a Kanban board that includes the completion of research and essay within the next week, the completion of the Pompeiian theatre (which will act as a completed proof of concept, where the rest of the game will be "White Boxed"), and the 3D model of the tour guide.
